# Programming Basics: Basic String Methods

These exercises are aimed at making you more familiar with string methods as well as string interpolation. Print your results of each exercise to the console. Use the terminal to view your results. 

### Instructions
- work in `solution.js`

1. Declare a variable named `parkWalkStr` with the value "I can walk in the park all day!". Print the word "park" to the console.

2. Declare a variable named `helloStr` with the value "Hello World". Covert the value to upper case and print the converted value to the console.

3. Declare another variable named `earthlingsStr` with the value "Hello Earthling". Convert the value to lower case and print the converted value to the console. 

4. Declare a variable named `jsStr` with the value "JavaScript". Use a string method to print the characters "aSc" from your declared variable.

5. Declare a variable named `niceShoesStr` with the value "nice shoes". Use a string method to check if the sentence "nice shoes" contains the letters l or n. Print the result of each check to the console.

6. Create a variable named `oldStr` and assign a word of your choice as its value. Create another variable named `newStr` and as its value assign the value of `oldStr` with the first character of the string added at the front and back, i.e.: Bananas => BBananasB

7. Create a variable named `scritcherStr` and assign a word of your choice with at least 3 characters as its value. Create another variable named `lastThreeChars` and use a string method to get the last 3 characters of `scritcherStr` and assign them as the value of the new variable. Add the value of `lastThreeChars` to the beginning **and** end of `scritcherStr` and print the result to the console, expected output: Scritch => tchScritchtch

8. Create a variable named `boogieNightsStr` and assign a word of your choice with at least 2 characters as its value. Switch the places of the first and last charecters and print the result to the console, expected output: BoogieWoogie => eoogieWoogiB

9. Create 3 variables named `firstName`, `city` and `job` and assign string values, i.e, const firstName = "Maria"; const city = "Berlin", etc. Print a sentence to the console using the variables and string interpolation, i.e., "My name is Maria. I live in Berlin and I am a teacher". 

10. Declare a variable named `foxStr` and assign the value "the quick brown fox" (all in lower case). Capitalize the first letter of that string. Print the result to the console.
